Hey everyone!

I've been working on **DotSlayer**, a roguelike action game that runs entirely in your browser. Here's what makes it special:

**Features:**

- Skill tree with 15+ upgrades
- Boss battles every 5 floors
- Global leaderboards

**Why browser-based?**
I wanted to create something anyone could play instantly - no downloads, no installs, just click and play.
